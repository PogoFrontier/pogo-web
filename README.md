## Introduction
Project Grookey (WIP name) aims to recreate the Pok√©mon Go battling feature in an online web environment. A user should open their browser, build a team, find an opponent, and have a full Pok√©mon battle. We plan only to simulate battling, so we heavily encourage everyone to also play the Pok√©mon Go mobile app. Through Project Grookey, we hope both new and current players become further invested in the game's community.

## Installation
Project Grookey is a NextJs + Express + WebSocket application. To run this project, you need to clone both this frontend repository and our [backend repository](https://github.com/DeveloperKhan/pogo-web-backend). If you want to build or contribute to the project, check out the backend README.

<b>Note:</b> If you haven't used npm before, make sure to [install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) it first.

## Project Status
Currently, this project is in private beta. We are still inviting people, so here is the [link](https://forms.gle/5ZFB8QDp8z8cDk468) if you are interested in testing.
 
We'll update this repository with major milestones. You can get the MOST up to date information from our [Github Issues](https://github.com/DeveloperKhan/pogo-web/issues). Many similar projects have stalled, so we will keep our progress very public to not suffer the same fate.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute, feel free to reach out to AdibKhan on Discord (AdibKhan#5314). We are always looking for help on our [issues board](https://github.com/DeveloperKhan/pogo-web/issues). However, you either need to fork the repository OR get access from me to be a contributor.

## Author
Hi, I'm Adib. I've been a competitive PoGo player for a little over a year and was at one point (December 4th) the [#1 ranked player in the world](https://ibb.co/Tq2mG2N). I love the game and its supportive, heartwarming community. I'm building Project Grookey as another way the community can connect, especially for players who may not have every Pok√©mon or looking for stress-free practice.
