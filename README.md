## Introduction
Project Grookey (WIP name) aims to recreate the Pokémon Go battling feature in an online web environment. A user should open their browser, build a team, find an opponent, and have a full Pokémon battle. We plan only to simulate battling, so we heavily encourage everyone to also play the Pokémon Go mobile app. Through Project Grookey, we hope both new and current players become further invested in the game's community.

## Installation
Project Grookey is a NextJs + Express + WebSocket application. To run this project, you need to clone both this frontend repository and our [backend repository](https://github.com/DeveloperKhan/pogo-web-backend). If you want to build or contribute to the project, check out the backend README.

<b>Note:</b> If you haven't used npm before, make sure to [install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) it first.

## Project Status
Currently, this project is in private beta. We are still inviting people, so here is the [link](https://forms.gle/5ZFB8QDp8z8cDk468) if you are interested in testing.
 
We'll update this repository with major milestones. You can get the MOST up to date information from our [Github Issues](https://github.com/DeveloperKhan/pogo-web/issues). Many similar projects have stalled, so we will keep our progress very public to not suffer the same fate.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute, feel free to reach out to AdibKhan on Discord (AdibKhan#5314). We are always looking for help on our [issues board](https://github.com/DeveloperKhan/pogo-web/issues). However, you either need to fork the repository OR get access from me to be a contributor.

## Author
Hi, I'm Adib. I've been a competitive PoGo player for a little over a year and was at one point (December 4th) the [#1 ranked player in the world](https://ibb.co/Tq2mG2N). I love the game and its supportive, heartwarming community. I'm building Project Grookey as another way the community can connect, especially for players who may not have every Pokémon or looking for stress-free practice.
